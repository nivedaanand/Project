Title: Text Summarization Project Report Using Daily CNN Model and SAMSum Data

Introduction: The project aims to develop a text summarization model using the Daily CNN model and SAMSum dataset. 
              Text summarization is a process of shortening long pieces of text into a concise summary that retains key information content and overall meaning.

Methodology: The Daily CNN model, a sequence-to-sequence model, was used for this project. This model is known for its effectiveness in text summarization tasks. 
             The SAMSum dataset, a large corpus of human-annotated dialogue summaries, was used for training and testing the model.

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The SAMSum dataset was collected and preprocessed for the model. The dataset was cleaned, tokenized, and converted into a format suitable 
                                  for the model. The dataset was then split into training, validation, and testing sets.

Model Training: The Daily CNN model was trained on the preprocessed SAMSum dataset. The model was trained for several epochs until the loss on the validation set started to 
                increase, indicating overfitting.

Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated on the test set using various metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores. The model showed 
                  promising results, with high ROUGE scores indicating that the generated summaries were close to the reference summaries.

Results and Discussion: The model was able to generate coherent and concise summaries for the given text. However, there were some instances where the model failed to capture 
                        the key points in the text. Future work could focus on improving the model's ability to capture the key points in the text.

Conclusion: The project demonstrated the effectiveness of the Daily CNN model in text summarization tasks using the SAMSum dataset. The model showed promising results, 
            but there is still room for improvement. Future work could focus on improving the model's performance and exploring other models for text summarization.
